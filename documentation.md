## Overview
This is the main file that is loaded when using this program, it includes the other files. This file contains the main function calls to be used by the user.

## Overview
This file holds the rules that are applied by the simplification function. These rules do not just have to be for mathematical simplification, but for a conversition of one term to another. This fact is seen by using the second ruleset for computing a laplace transform. Rules are lists of individual rules, where an individule rule is a set with a given and what it changes into (left and right).
